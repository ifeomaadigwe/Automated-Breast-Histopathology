# Case Study: Automated Breast Histopathology Slide Triage  
**Reducing Pathologist Backlog with Deep Learning**

---
## Company Overview

**Histocare Diagnostics Ltd.** is a Cambridge-based digital pathology provider founded in 2010 by histopathologists and AI engineers from the University of Cambridge. Now a regional leader in cloud-based slide management and diagnostic support, Histocare is tackling the growing challenge of breast cancer screening overload.

---
## Business Challenge

With breast cancer screening volumes rising over **20% annually**, the UK’s pathologist workforce has struggled to keep pace. Histocare’s average turnaround time (TAT) for routine breast biopsy slides has doubled—from **5 days in 2020 to 10 days in 2024**.

---
## Project Rationale

This project leverages **deep learning** to triage histopathology slides into:
- **Likely Benign**: Can be deprioritized or auto-archived
- **Requires Pathologist Review**: Flagged for expert attention

By automating this first-pass classification, we aim to **reduce workload**, **accelerate diagnosis**, and **optimize expert time**.

---
## Strategic Goals

1. **Reduce Turnaround Time**  
   Prioritize malignant cases for faster treatment initiation.

2. **Optimize Expert Time**  
   Free pathologists from reviewing low-risk benign slides.

3. **Lower Operational Costs**  
   Reduce slide-processing and review overhead.

4. **Ensure NHS Compliance**  
   Meet <7-day TAT targets to avoid penalties.

5. **Strengthen Market Position**  
   Establish Histocare as a leader in AI-enabled diagnostics.

## Data Source

I used the **Breast Histopathology Images (BreakHis)** dataset from Kaggel, which contains thousands of microscopic images labeled as benign or malignant. Images were resized, normalized, and split into training and test sets using stratified sampling.

---
## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Images loaded and indexed with labels.

2. **Class Imbalance Handling**  
   Weighted sampling to balance benign/malignant cases.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   Resizing to 224×224, normalization, and tensor conversion.

4. **Model Training**  
   Fine-tuned `ResNet18` pretrained on ImageNet.

5. **Evaluation**  
   Metrics calculated: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
   Confusion matrix and metric plots saved to `artifacts/`.

6. **Model Saving**  
   Trained weights saved as `.pth` for reuse and deployment.

---
## Experiment Tracking

We used **MLflow** to log:
- Hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs)
- Evaluation metrics
- Model artifacts and plots

This enables easy comparison across model versions and training runs.

---
## Visualization & Deployment

### ✅ Streamlit Dashboard (`app.py`)
- Upload image → Get prediction + confidence
- View evaluation metrics and confusion matrix (collapsible)

### ✅ FastAPI + Swagger UI (`main.py`)
- `/predict` endpoint for image classification
- Auto-generated docs at `/docs` for testing and integration

##  What We’re Achieving

By automating slide triage, we’re:
- **Reducing benign-case reviews by up to 60%**
- **Accelerating malignant case detection**
- **Helping Histocare meet NHS compliance targets**
- **Positioning Histocare as a pioneer in AI-powered pathology**
